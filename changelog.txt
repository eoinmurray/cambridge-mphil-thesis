Figure 1.2

Single photon emission process in a quantum dot.

A single photon emission process in a quantum dot. A photon (\gamma in the
image) excites an electron from the Valence band to the Conduction band, this
creates an exciton. This exciton can relax into the quantum dot and after some
time $\tau$ it will recombine and emit another photon. Since the quantum dot
energy leves are discrete, and only accept a fixed number of carriers and after
photon emission there is a finite time which must pass before more carriers can
be captured, true single photon emission is possible.

Light ray propagation in a planar dielectric waveguide.

Light ray propagation in a planar dielectric waveguide. The unguided ray
impinges on the boundary at angle larger than $\theta_c$ and therefore some of
the light refracts, losing power at each reflection causing the ray to gradually
disappear. The guided ray impinges at an angle less than $\theta_c$ and reflects
fully propagating long the core without any loss of power.

LHS of the equation and the red line is the RHS. Each LHS segment corresponds to
a mode in the waveguide.

Example NOON state sensor using a single photon source and a photonic circuit.
In this case the temperature of the heater is being sensed.

A single photon is emitted and impinges on the 50:50 beamsplitter, where one is
delayed. The two photons will then interfere at the first DC, generating a NOON
state. The state travels down paths 1 and 2, gathering a phase due to the
presence of the heater on path 1. The phase of the MZI, and thus the temperature
of the heater, can be determined accurately from analysing how output
coincidences change with temperature.

Schematic of waveguide characterisation experiment. Two PM V-groove arrays are
aligned to the side  of the waveguide chip. One of the V-groove channels injects
laser light into port 1. The light is split by the DC and then collected from
port 3 and 4 by another (generally multimode) V-groove array and sent to a power
meter. The power ratios of of port 3 and 4 are used to calculate the coupling
ratio of the DC.

Typical micro-Photoluminescence setup to excite the QD sample with a laser and
collect the QD light. The orange light is the laser and the red light is the
path the QD light takes. The QD light travels in free space through two 92/8
beamsplitters, with 92\% transmission. With the two beamsplitters, the laser,
LED and CCD elements can be placed in the optical path of the QD light, while
minimising the amount of QD light lost. The QD light is collected by a  fibre
coupled collimator and sent to a silicon charged coupled device (liquid nitrogen
cooled) equipped spectrometer.

Schematic of HBT experiment taking place on the Hybrid chip. The light from
ports 1 and 2 of the hybrid chip is collected by the V-groove array and sent
towards transmission gratings in order to spectrally isolate the QD light.  The
light in both channels then impinge on APDs. The APD clicks are then correlated
on a timing card.

the  SiON chip (top-right) which is in turn bonded to a six channel V-groove
array (bottom-left of chip). The nichrome channels allow a phase-varying heating
current to be applied to the MZ's. The structure is glued to a copper block is
placed in a cryostat for the duration of experiments.

orange) exciting QDs in the III-V chip. The QD light (path highlighted in red)
enters a heater tuned MZI. The QD light is collected by V-grooves and sent
through transmission gratings towards APDs in order to do correlations.

## Check with Toshiba the possibility that I can add more details to the axis
## graphs (changing to arbitrary units to an actual count rate).

I have spoken to David Ellis and Toshiba will not allow me to include count rates.

- Add a few more fundamental references (things like HBT).
