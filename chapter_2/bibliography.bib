  abstract={We report the observation of a Purcell enhancement in the radiative decay rate of a single quantum dot, embedded in a microcavity light-emitting-diode structure. Lateral confinement of the optical mode was achieved using an annulus of low-refractive-index aluminium oxide, formed by wet oxidation. The same layer acts as a current aperture, reducing the active area of the device without impeding the electrical properties of the p-i-n diode. This allowed single photon electroluminescence to be demonstrated at repetition rates up to 0.5?GHz.}

abstract = {One- and two-photon interference visibilities observed with the exciton emission from a quantum dot microcavity single-photon source are sensitive to the excitation conditions. In particular, the coherence time of the source is reduced with increasing pump power or excitation of the barrier layers. Furthermore, the two-photon interference visibility is affected by a long lived population of the biexciton state in the dot. This suggests that two-photon interference may be improved by controlling the exciton dynamics in the dot or by improved temporal resolution of the detection set-up.},
